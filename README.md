# Graph--Find-Topological-order

Instructions to compile : 

DFS file needs Graph code to compile and run successfully.



Input Format : 

1) Here, input to DFS.java is in String.  You can pass the graph input in String in Main Function.

2) The input string needs to be in following format : 
	String input = “Num_vertex 	Num_edges 		Vertex1  Vertex2  Weight_V1V2  ………….”

3) Starting vertex needs to be 1 and all other vertices should be continuous as the Graph.java needs the input to be in that way.
